**Description**: Create a simple library management system where users can borrow and return books.
- **Features**:
    - Classes: Book, User, Library.
    - Attributes: Book (title, author, ISBN, availability), User (name, ID, borrowedBooks).
    - Methods: Borrow book, return book, display available books.
- **OOP Concepts**:
    - **Encapsulation** (keep attributes private, use getters/setters),
    - **Polymorphism** (method overloading for borrowing books by title or ISBN).

Explanation of OOP Concepts
Encapsulation:
    Attributes of Book, User, and Library are private, and we use getters/setters to access them.
Polymorphism:
    Method overloading is used in the Library class for borrowing books (borrowBook by title and borrowBookByISBN by ISBN).
Abstraction:
    The Library class abstracts the logic of managing books and provides simple methods for users to interact.
Inheritance:
    Not explicitly used here but can be extended if additional roles (e.g., Admin, Member) are introduced.
